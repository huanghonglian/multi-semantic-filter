Processing 39335135.ti.1: Gastric Cancer: An Up-to-Date Review with New Insights into Early-Onset Gastric  Cancer.

Processing 39335135.ti.2: LID - 10.3390/cancers16183163 [doi] LID - 3163

Processing 39335135.ab.1: Gastric cancer is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth  most common cause of cancer death in the world.

Processing 39335135.ab.2: Regarding the age at which the  diagnosis was made, Gastric cancer is divided into early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC-up to 45  years of age) and conventional Gastric cancer (older than 45).

Processing 39335135.ab.3: EOGC constitutes approximately  10% of all GCs.

Processing 39335135.ab.4: Numerous reports indicate that EOGC is more aggressive than  conventional Gastric cancer and is often discovered at an advanced tumor stage, which has an  impact on the five-year survival rate.

Processing 39335135.ab.5: The median survival rate for  advanced-stage Gastric cancer is very poor, amounting to less than 12 months.

Processing 39335135.ab.6: Risk factors  for Gastric cancer include family history, alcohol consumption, smoking, Helicobacter pylori,  and Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Processing 39335135.ab.7: It has been shown that a proper diet and  lifestyle can play a preventive role in Gastric cancer.

Processing 39335135.ab.8: However, research indicates that risk  factors for conventional Gastric cancer are less correlated with EOGC.

Processing 39335135.ab.9: In addition, the  unclear etiology of EOGC and the late diagnosis of this disease limit the  possibilities of effective treatment.

Processing 39335135.ab.10: Genetic factors are considered a likely  cause of EOGC, as young patients are less exposed to environmental carcinogens.

Processing 39335135.ab.11: Research characterizing Gastric cancer in young patients is scarce.

Processing 39335135.ab.12: This comprehensive study  presents all aspects: epidemiology, risk factors, new treatment strategies, and  future directions.

Processing 39306800.ab.4: Immunohistochemistry for CLDN18 (43-14A  clone), PD-L1 (22C3 pharmDx), HER2, and FGFR2 was performed.

Processing 39306800.ab.5: Claudin 18.2 positivity  was defined as moderate-to-strong (2+/3+) membranous staining in >/=75% of tumor  cells.

Processing 39306800.ab.6: Claudin 18.2 expression was compared with biomarker expression, Epstein-Barr  virus association and microsatellite instability status, and  clinicopathologic features.

Processing 39306800.ab.7: RESULT: Claudin 18.2 was positive in 34.4% of the  patients.

Processing 39306800.ab.8: Claudin 18.2 positivity was significantly higher in the middle and upper  thirds than in the lower third gastric location (P < .001), but there was no  correlation with age, sex, or stage (P > .05).

Processing 39306800.ab.9: Claudin 18.2 positivity was rare  (2.8%) in mucinous adenocarcinoma but frequent (90.9%) in a majority of gastric  carcinomas with lymphoid stroma.

Processing 39306800.ab.10: Claudin 18.2 positivity was higher in Epstein-Barr  virus-associated  (P < .001) and PD-L1-positive (PD-L1 CPS >/= 5) gastric cancer (P = .014) but lower in HER2  positive gastric cancer (P = .005).
