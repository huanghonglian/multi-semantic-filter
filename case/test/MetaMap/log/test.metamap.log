Processing 29735578.ti.1: Lifestyle and Environmental Factors in Multiple Sclerosis.

Processing 29735578.ti.2: LID - 10.1101/cshperspect.a028944 [doi] LID - a028944

Processing 29735578.ab.1: Lifestyle and environmental factors potently influence the risk of multiple  sclerosis, because genetic predisposition only explains a fraction of the  risk increase.

Processing 29735578.ab.2: There is strong evidence for associations of Epstein-Barr virus infection, smoking, sun exposure/vitamin D, and adolescent obesity to risk  of multiple  sclerosis.

Processing 29735578.ab.3: There is also circumstantial evidence on organic solvents and shift work,  all associate with greater risk, although certain factors like nicotine, alcohol,  and a high coffee consumption associate with a reduced risk.

Processing 29735578.ab.4: Certain factors,  smoking, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and obesity interact with human leukocyte antigen  risk genes, arguing for a pathogenic pathway involving adaptive immunity.

Processing 29735578.ab.5: There  is a potential for prevention, in particular for people at greater risk such as  relatives of individuals with multiple  sclerosis.

Processing 29735578.ab.6: All of the described factors for multiple  sclerosis may  influence adaptive and/or innate immunity, as has been argued for multiple  sclerosis risk gene  variants.
