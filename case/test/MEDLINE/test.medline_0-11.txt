AB  - c-Myc is an important proto-oncogene belonging to the MYC family. In normal 
      conditions, c-Myc regulates different aspects of cellular function. However, its 
      dysregulation can result in the development of cancer due to various mechanisms. 
      Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous viral pathogen that infects a huge proportion 
      of the global population. This virus is linked to various cancers, such as 
      different types of lymphoma, nasopharyngeal, and gastric cancers. It can 
      manipulate host cells, and many cellular and viral genes are important in the 
      Epstein-Barr virus carcinogenesis. This review explores the complex relationship 
      between c-Myc and Epstein-Barr virus in the context of cancer development. Also, 
      potential therapeutic strategies targeting c-Myc to treat EBV-related cancers are 
      discussed.

TI  - Predictive Biomarkers of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Gastric Cancer: A 
      Reference of Clinicopathological Characteristics, Protein Expression, 
      Epstein-Barr Virus Status, and Microsatellite Instability.
PG  - 4435-4448

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in early gastric cancer 
      (EGC) is crucial for making treatment decisions. This study aimed to confirm risk 
      factors for LNM and identify novel auxiliary biomarkers for predicting LNM in 
      EGC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We established a training set, comprising 63 patients 
      with LNM-EGC and 274 patients with non-LNM EGC, and a test set, comprising 19 
      patients with LNM-EGC and 146 non-LNM EGC. Immunohistochemistry for 
      lymphangiogenic and related pathway components (VEGF-C, TGF-beta1, SMAD2/3, VEGF-D, 
      pSTAT3, E-cadherin, CD44, c-MET, YAP, and HER2), in situ hybridization for 
      Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs, and multiplex PCR for microsatellite 
      instability were conducted. RESULTS: In the training set, Lauren's diffuse/mixed 
      classification, stromal desmoplasia, submucosal invasion >/=500 mum, lymphatic 
      invasion, and high VEGF-C and SMAD2/3 expression were independent risk factors 
      for LNM (p<0.05). A large tumor size, mixed histology, submucosal invasion, 
      perineural invasion, and ulceration were determined as risk factors using 
      univariate analysis (p<0.05). The tumor cutoff size for predicting LNM was 2.65 
      cm, based on a ROC analysis. The test set study verified that stromal 
      desmoplasia, submucosal invasion, and high VEGF-C expression were independent 
      risk factors for LNM (p<0.05). Moreover, mixed histology, lymphatic invasion, 
      ulceration, and high SMAD 2/3 expression were identified as additional risk 
      factors using univariate analysis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Stromal desmoplasia, 
      submucosal invasion, and high VEGF-C expression are potential biomarkers for LNM 
      in EGC. VEGF-C expression might serve as an adjunct biomarker for predicting LNM 
      on forceps-biopsy tissue at initial diagnosis.

      Treatment Prospects, a Literature Review.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens13090728 [doi]
LID - 728
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is a complex disease with various etiologies. While 
      Helicobacter pylori infection is still one of the leading risk factors for GC, 
      increasing evidence suggests a link between GC and other infective agents such as 
      Epstein Bar Virus (EBV). EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is now recognized 
      as a distinct subgroup of GC, and the complex interactions between the virus and 
      gastric mucosa may influence its development. A recent integrative analysis of 
      the genome and proteome of GC tissues by The Cancer Genome Atlas project has 
      identified EBVaGC as a specific subtype characterized by PIK3CA and ARID1A 
      mutations, extensive DNA hyper-methylation, and activation of immune signaling 
      pathways. These molecular characteristics are markers of the unique molecular 
      profile of this subset of GC and are potential targets for therapy. This review 
      aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on EBVaGC. It will focus on 
      the epidemiology, clinic-pathological features, and genetic characteristics of 
      EBVaGC. Additionally, it will discuss recent data indicating the potential use of 
      EBV infection as a predictive biomarker of response to chemotherapy and immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors. The review also delves into potential therapeutic 
      approaches for EBVaGC, including targeted therapies and adoptive immunotherapy, 
      highlighting the promising potential of EBV as a therapeutic target.

      Cancer.

LID - 3163
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth 
      most common cause of cancer death in the world. Regarding the age at which the 
      diagnosis was made, GC is divided into early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC-up to 45 
      years of age) and conventional GC (older than 45). EOGC constitutes approximately 
      10% of all GCs. Numerous reports indicate that EOGC is more aggressive than 
      conventional GC and is often discovered at an advanced tumor stage, which has an 
      impact on the five-year survival rate. The median survival rate for 
      advanced-stage GC is very poor, amounting to less than 12 months. Risk factors 
      for GC include family history, alcohol consumption, smoking, Helicobacter pylori, 
      and Epstein-Barr virus infection. It has been shown that a proper diet and 
      lifestyle can play a preventive role in GC. However, research indicates that risk 
      factors for conventional GC are less correlated with EOGC. In addition, the 
      unclear etiology of EOGC and the late diagnosis of this disease limit the 
      possibilities of effective treatment. Genetic factors are considered a likely 
      cause of EOGC, as young patients are less exposed to environmental carcinogens. 
      Research characterizing GC in young patients is scarce. This comprehensive study 
      presents all aspects: epidemiology, risk factors, new treatment strategies, and 
      future directions.

TI  - Clinicopathologic and molecular characterization of stages II-IV gastric cancer 
      with Claudin 18.2 expression.
LID - oyae238 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyae238 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) is a promising target for targeted therapies 
      in gastric cancer (GC). This study investigated the prevalence of CLDN18.2 
      expression in patients with stages II-IV GC or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) 
      adenocarcinoma and its correlation with clinicopathologic features and other 
      crucial GC biomarkers. METHODS: We enrolled 1000 patients diagnosed with stages 
      II-IV GC after surgical treatment. Immunohistochemistry for CLDN18 (43-14A 
      clone), PD-L1 (22C3 pharmDx), HER2, and FGFR2 was performed. CLDN18.2 positivity 
      was defined as moderate-to-strong (2+/3+) membranous staining in >/=75% of tumor 
      cells. CLDN18.2 expression was compared with biomarker expression, Epstein-Barr 
      virus (EBV) association and microsatellite instability status, and 
      clinicopathologic features. RESULT: CLDN18.2 was positive in 34.4% of the 
      patients. CLDN18.2 positivity was significantly higher in the middle and upper 
      thirds than in the lower third gastric location (P < .001), but there was no 
      correlation with age, sex, or stage (P > .05). CLDN18.2 positivity was rare 
      (2.8%) in mucinous adenocarcinoma but frequent (90.9%) in a majority of gastric 
      carcinomas with lymphoid stroma. CLDN18.2 positivity was higher in EBV-associated 
      (P < .001) and PD-L1-positive (PD-L1 CPS >/= 5) GC (P = .014) but lower in HER2 
      positive GC (P = .005). CLDN18.2 positivity was not significantly associated with 
      overall survival and disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: This study provides a 
      comprehensive evaluation of CLDN18.2 status and its correlation with the 
      clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with stages II-IV GC in Korea and 
      with crucial biomarkers. It may be valuable for guiding future drug development, 
      expanding treatment options, and ultimately improving patient outcomes in GC.

TI  - HCMV detection in Asian gastric cancer RNA-seq data sets and clinical validation 
      in Indian GC patients reveals the HCMV-GC specific gene signatures.
PG  - e0067324
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00673-24 [doi]
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) prevalence is very high in the Asian population. Oncogenic 
      viruses play a crucial role in the progression of different types of cancers. 
      Through reanalysis of clinical RNA-seq data sets derived from Asian GC patients, 
      this study identified the presence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in Asian GC 
      tumors, next to the well-studied association of EBV. Clinical recruitment of the 
      Indian GC cohort and screening for HCMV presence identified a 14.28% occurrence, 
      similar to that observed in the bioinformatics analysis. A combinatorial approach 
      of rank-based meta-analysis and ranking of groups based on an 
      expectation-maximization algorithm identified that the upregulated LINC02864 and 
      MAGEA10 correlated with poor survival of GC patients and downregulated tumor 
      suppressor genes enriching for gastric acid secretion pathway to be associated 
      with HCMV-positive GC patients, revealing the progressive role of HCMV infection 
      in GC. Genes that discriminate between different stages of GC were identified 
      through feature selection implemented in a machine-learning approach. LTF and 
      KLK10 expressions were found to be specifically dysregulated by HCMV and can also 
      indicate the GC stages. The results of this study will guide future studies to 
      identify the functional role of these genes in the HCMV-associated 
      GC.IMPORTANCENearly 75% of gastric cancer (GC) cases reported globally are from 
      the Asian population. Most existing public databases, such as TCGA, comprise only 
      a fractional portion of data derived from Asian ancestry. This study identified 
      EBV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)'s higher detection in GC patients. The 
      presence and role of EBV associated with GC are well-known, and the observation 
      of HCMV prompted us to validate the findings in a small cohort of 40 Indian GC 
      patients. We observed a 14.28% occurrence of HCMV in the Indian cohort, similar 
      to that observed from next-generation sequencing. A combinatorial approach of 
      rank-based meta-analysis and ranking of groups based on an 
      expectation-maximization algorithm identified that the upregulated LINC02864 and 
      MAGEA10 correlated with poor survival of GC patients and downregulated tumor 
      suppressor genes enriching for gastric acid secretion pathway to be associated 
      with HCMV-positive GC patients, revealing the progressive role of HCMV infection 
      in GC.

PG  - 745-753

AB  - A 62-year-old man presented with fever and anorexia since July X. Initial 
      treatments were rendered ineffective, and due to altered consciousness and 
      vomiting, he was referred to our hospital. On admission, he manifested delirium, 
      drowsiness, and disorientation. While blood tests were normal, gastroscopy 
      identified a type 3 tumor in his lower gastric body, later diagnosed as a poorly 
      differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated negative human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and positive programmed death-ligand 1 
      expression with a combined positive score >/=5. Furthermore, a positive 
      Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization result was noted. 
      Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT and PET-CT scans demonstrated multiple lymph node 
      metastases around the stomach and liver, establishing the diagnosis of stage IVB 
      gastric cancer (T4aN2M1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated 
      enhanced lesions in the brainstem, cerebellar sulci, and right occipital lobe. 
      Although cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative for malignancy, the clinical 
      symptoms and MRI findings confirmed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC). The 
      patient underwent radiotherapy for LMC (total of 30Gy in 10 fractions), followed 
      by combination therapy with a nivolumab and SOX regimen. Posttreatment, the LMC 
      symptoms resolved;however, he experienced grade 3 immune-related adverse events 
      related to liver dysfunction. Nivolumab was discontinued, and with steroid 
      administration, the adverse events improved. Imaging evaluations posttreatment 
      showed gastric tumor reduction and the absence of LMC. After 7 cycles, nivolumab 
      was reintroduced, with no liver dysfunction recurrence noted through 15 cycles. 
      Endoscopic examination 1 year postonset demonstrated that the gastric tumor had 
      scarred, and MRI showed no signs of LMC recurrence. In 5-8% of solid tumors, LMC 
      complications are present, resulting in limited treatment options and poor 
      prognosis. Recent reports suggest the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
      in treating intracranial metastasis from solid tumors. In Japan, nivolumab was 
      approved for gastric cancer treatment in 2017 and for first-line therapy in 
      combination with chemotherapy since 2021. We report a case in which radiotherapy 
      and chemotherapy combined with nivolumab provided durable control of LMC 
      originating from gastric cancer for more than 1 year.

AB  - Mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gastric 
      cancer (GC) exhibits an immune-active tumor microenvironment (TME) compared to 
      MMR proficient (pMMR)/microsatellite stable/Epstein-Barr virus-negative [EBV (-)] 
      GC. The tumor cell-intrinsic cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of 
      interferon genes (STING) pathway has been considered a key regulator of immune 
      cell activation in the TME. However, its significance in regulating the 
      immune-active TME in dMMR/MSI-H GC remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that 
      tumor cell-intrinsic cGAS-STING was highly expressed in dMMR GC compared to 
      pMMR/EBV (-) GC. The expression of tumor cell-intrinsic STING was significantly 
      and positively associated with the number of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating 
      lymphocytes in GC. Analysis of TCGA datasets revealed that the expression of 
      interferon-stimulated genes and STING downstream T-cell attracting chemokines was 
      significantly higher in MSI-H GC compared to other subtypes of GC with EBV (-). 
      These results suggest that tumor cell-intrinsic STING signaling plays a key role 
      in activating immune cells in the dMMR/MSI-H GC TME and might serve as a novel 
      biomarker predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy for GC treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment of lung, colon, and gastric cancer 
      through the histologic characteristics and genomic biomarkers have not had a 
      strong impact on the mortality rates of the top three global causes of death by 
      cancer. METHODS: Twenty-five transcriptomic analyses (10 lung cancer, 10 gastric 
      cancer, and 5 colon cancer datasets) followed our own bioinformatic pipeline 
      based on the utilization of specialized libraries from the R language and DAVID s 
      gene enrichment analyses to identify a regulatory metafirm network of 
      transcription factors and target genes common in every type of cancer, with 
      experimental evidence that supports its relationship with the unlocking of cell 
      phenotypic plasticity for the acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer during the 
      tumoral process. The network's regulatory functional and signaling pathways might 
      depend on the constant crosstalk with the microbiome network established in the 
      oral-gut-lung axis. RESULTS: The global transcriptomic network analysis 
      highlighted the impact of transcription factors (SOX4, TCF3, TEAD4, ETV4, and 
      FOXM1) that might be related to stem cell programming and cancer progression 
      through the regulation of the expression of genes, such as cancer-cell membrane 
      receptors, that interact with several microorganisms, including human T-cell 
      leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1), the human papilloma virus (HPV), the Epstein-Barr 
      virus (EBV), and SARS-CoV-2. These interactions can trigger the MAPK, 
      non-canonical WNT, and IFN signaling pathways, which regulate key transcription 
      factor overexpression during the establishment and progression of lung, colon, 
      and gastric cancer, respectively, along with the formation of the microbiome 
      network. CONCLUSION: The global transcriptomic network analysis highlights the 
      important interaction between key transcription factors in lung, colon, and 
      gastric cancer, which regulates the expression of cancer-cell membrane receptors 
      for the interaction with the microbiome network during the tumorigenic process.

TI  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is targeted by EBV-encoded miR-BART20-5p and regulates 
      cell autophagy, proliferation, and migration in EBV-associated gastric cancer.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the first human oncogenic virus known to express 
      microRNAs (miRNAs), which are closely associated with the development of various 
      tumors, including nasopharyngeal and gastric cancers. Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 
      (SCD1) is a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, highly expressed in numerous 
      tumors, promoting tumor growth and metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic 
      target. In this study, we found that SCD1 expression in EBV-associated gastric 
      cancer (EBVaGC) was significantly lower than in EBV-negative gastric cancer 
      (EBVnGC) at both cellular and tissue levels. In addition, EBV-miR-BART20-5p 
      targets the 3'-UTR of SCD1, downregulating its expression. Moreover, 
      overexpression of SCD1 in EBVaGC cells promoted cell migration and proliferation 
      while inhibiting autophagy. These results suggest that EBV-encoded 
      miRNA-BART20-5p may contribute to EBVaGC progression by targeting SCD1.
